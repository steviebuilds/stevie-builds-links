### 😤 Pain Point Attack
1. "POV: The PM who can't explain their job is explaining your job to you"
2. "That moment when the client says 'just one small change'"
3. "Senior dev: 'works on my machine.' Meeting over."
4. "Day 47 of waiting for code review on a 3-line fix"

### 🤝 Permission Giving
1. "If you're 30+ and thinking about learning to code..."
2. "You don't need to understand everything to start building"
3. "Your first 100 projects will suck. Build them anyway"

## Week 1 Scripts

### 📱 Script 1: "Teaching Junior Toxic Habits"

**Format**: Quick cuts, text overlay
**Duration**: 15-20 seconds

**SHOT LIST:**
1. **Opening (you at desk)**: "When you're overemployed and the junior dev asks for AWS help"
2. **Screen recording**: Show the 'toxic' fix (comment out the problematic code)
3. **Cut to junior's face**: Shocked/confused expression
4. **Your deadpan delivery**: "There, AWS costs fixed"
5. **Junior typing furiously**: "But... but this breaks production!"
6. **Final shot**: You already in another meeting, muted

**Caption**: 
"I'm becoming the senior dev I swore I'd never be 💀

Teaching the next generation all the wrong lessons because I'm juggling 3 contracts.

'It works locally' is now my entire personality.

#juniordev #webdev #programmerhumor #tech #coding"

### 📱 Script 2: "Stop Learning, Start Building"

**Format**: Direct to camera, Hormozi-style
**Duration**: 30-45 seconds

**SHOT LIST:**
1. **Hook (intense close-up)**: "Stop learning to code."
2. **Pull back, gesture**: "I'm serious. Close the tutorial right now."
3. **Walk and talk**: "You've watched 47 hours of Python courses..."
4. **Stop, face camera**: "Built anything? No? That's the problem."
5. **Show phone/laptop**: "This app? Garbage code. Makes $5k/month."
6. **Final close-up**: "Ship trash. Get feedback. Ship less trash. Repeat."

**Caption**:
"After 2 years of tutorial hell, I finally understood:

Nobody cares how clean your code is if it doesn't solve a problem.

My first app was 90% Stack Overflow. It still made more money than my 'perfect' projects that never shipped.

Stop learning. Start building. Today.

#buildinpublic #indiehacker #webdevelopment #learntocode"

### 📱 Script 3: "First Day vs Now (Coder Reality)"

**Format**: Split screen comparison
**Duration**: 15-20 seconds

**SHOT LIST:**
1. **Split screen setup**: "First day coding" vs "5 years later"
2. **First day**: Excited, multiple monitors, taking notes, "I'll document everything!"
3. **Now**: One monitor, 47 Chrome tabs, coffee-stained desk
4. **First day**: "I'll never copy-paste from Stack Overflow"
5. **Now**: Cmd+C, Cmd+V without even reading
6. **Final comparison**: First day organizing files vs now "untitled_final_v2_actualfinal.js"

**Caption**:
"The coding journey nobody talks about 😅

Started: 'I'll write clean, documented code'
Now: 'console.log('HERE') everywhere'

At least I'm shipping products now instead of reorganizing my VS Code themes for the 100th time.

What's your biggest coding confession? 👇"
